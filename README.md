# GISHWHES-Mascot-Generator
A Mascot Generator for the Summer 2015 GISHWHES event. GISHWHES mascots are generally a mixture of two animals/insects. For example, 2015's mascot was Dinomite (mix of Dinosaur and Termite).
This python (Python 2.7.10) program is a quick test of [pygame](http://pygame.org/hifi.html).
